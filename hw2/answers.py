# Part 1 (Backprop) answers

part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**\
 1.\
 A. we can look at $\pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{X}}$ as a matrix D with the shape of X- (N,$D_{in}$) where every element $d_{ii} $ is $\pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{X_{ii}}}$. this also yields a matrix $D2$ with the size of Y - (N, $D_{out}$).\
 overall we get $(N, D_{in}, N, D_{out}) = (64,1024,64,512)$\
 \
 B. Yes most of the elements are zero because every output $Y_i$ is reliant only on the respective input $X_i$ so at every $D2$ only one row will be non-zero.\
 \
 C. We don't need to materialize the above Jacobian to calculate $\pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{X}}$ because we only the need the product $\pderiv{\mat{L}}{\mat{Y}} * \pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{X}}$ thanks to the chain rule.\
since $\pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{X}} = \mat{W}$ we can just compute $\pderiv{\mat{L}}{\mat{X}} * \mat{W}$.\
\
2.\
A following the logic above we can conclude that $\pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{W}}$ is of size $(512,1024,64,512)$.\
\
B. Same here. the Jacobian is sparse because only one score in a given y is reliant on some $w_{ii}$, so in every $D2$ matrix we will have only one non-zero column.\
in simpler terms every col in $\mat{Y}$ depends on one row in $\mat{W}$.\
\
C. Again we dont need. we can just compute $\pderiv{\mat{Y}}{\mat{W}} = \mat{X}$ and use the chain rule to compute $\delta\mat{W}$
 
"""

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**
 back-propagation is not required because we can just compute $\delta\mat{X}$ by hand.\
 this straight on approach will get very messy very quickly and it wouldn't be modular, i.e we would have to calculate again with every change we introduce to the architecture.
